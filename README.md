# complete_link_clustering
The program is implementation of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.The clusters here are grouped based on complete link.Many agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques are variations on single approach: start with an indivisual points as clusters,successively merge the two closest clusters until only one cluster remains.

The complete link or MAX version of hierarchical clustering,the proximity of two clusters is defined as the maximum of the distance(minimum of the similarity) between any two points in the two different clusters.

The repositary consists of the input and the output obtained by the implemented technique as text files.
